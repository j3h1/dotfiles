## Hello world!
> **NOTE**: Currently the scipt supports the following package managers: `apt` `dnf` `pacman`
> It's also recommended to install on a clean system.

To get started, you first have to add execute permissions to install script and then run it.

```
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```

After that you're done!
